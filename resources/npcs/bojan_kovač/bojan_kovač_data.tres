 Place of Birth: Nova Idrija, Wotlica
 Parents: Sonja and Željko Kovač – machinists, pre-Abandonment generation
Bojan doesn’t talk much about the past, unless it’s to make fun of it. He grew up in the lower decks of Nova Idrija, surrounded by noise, heat, and hard work. When the orbital lines fell silent, he didn’t mourn. He just kept hammering.
He moved to Colnica with a salvaged forge and a cart full of tools. He fixes things. Makes others better. Breaks what needs breaking. He's not here to inspire — he’s here to get the job done. Most folk steer clear of his muttering and sharp humor, but when something needs shaping, they show up.
The one thing Bojan is curious about is the Wajdovsko kopje — a spear of legend, said to be crafted with techniques long forgotten. He heard the librarian has the instructions, and while Bojan won’t beg or flatter, he’ll take those plans if they’re offered. Out of pride, mostly. Maybe a little hunger for legacy.
He doesn’t care for stories, but he knows how to make one real — in steel."
occupation = "Blacksmith"
location = "Colnica, forge built into the shell of an old rail maintenance shed. Smells like oil and scorched iron."
description = "Blunt, sarcastic, and stubborn. Doesn’t sugar-coat, doesn’t waste time. Cynical, but not cruel. He respects skill more than kindness, but he isn’t blind to good intentions."
