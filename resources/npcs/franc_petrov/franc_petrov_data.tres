name = "Franc Petrov"
life_history = "Born: 2120 A.G.
 Place of Birth: Ajdovec, Wotlica
 Parents: Mateja and Ludvik Petrov — children of first-wave settlers, greenhouse technicians
Franc Petrov was born during the peak years of Wotlica’s brief golden age, when Ajdovec's greenhouses still buzzed with filtered sunlight and humming pumps. His grandparents had arrived in the early days, hauling modular soil labs and irrigation columns across the Ajd Plain. By the time Franc came along, Ajdovec was a humming breadbasket — not yet broken by soil fatigue or market collapse.
But collapse came anyway.
By the 2140s, dust storms were choking out the crops. Trade slowed. Subsidies evaporated. And like many second-generation colonials, Franc grew up not in prosperity but in the afterglow of it — a childhood of salvaged parts and stubborn parents who believed things would turn around. They didn’t.
Franc left Ajdovec before he turned thirty, just another wandering mechanic with a knack for fixing pre-fab modules and a head full of stubborn, useful knowledge. For decades he traveled the ridges and rails of Wotlica, carting goods from the flooded roads near Gozdnik to the fading towers of Nova Idrija. His name became familiar — not famous, but known — the kind of man who showed up right after a storm, always with something useful.
In his middle years, he stayed longer than usual in Predmesa, drawn in by the way the town still held on to some strange sense of grace — open-air schools, midnight glass-burnings, and quiet, thoughtful people who remembered what Wotlica could have been.
That’s where he met Alenka, a reclusive scholar who had returned to her home town after the ecological faculty she taught at on Earth collapsed under debt. They shared long walks between overgrown stone rings and laughed at each other’s deeply incompatible sense of time. She measured life in seasons and symbols. Franc, in repair logs and supply runs.
Still, they stayed. Years passed. They had no children — a quiet choice. Her death came slowly, as it does for those who never complain. Franc never talks about it, except to say he doesn’t dream much anymore.
He keeps to himself but always gives fair weight, and he has a reputation for finding things people didn’t know they needed.
He wears a cracked smaragd ring, its green stone faintly marbled with silver. It once belonged to Alenka, though he never says her name. He doesn’t sell it, doesn’t take it off. Just sometimes stares at it when he thinks no one’s watching.
He says only one thing about it: “There’s someone out there who can fix it. Not remake it — fix it. That’s different.”
He also owns a leather-bound book, always kept wrapped and tucked into the wall behind his workbench. It's titled “The history of Wotlica – from its humble beginnings to today.” It was written by Alenka.

occupation = "Scholar"
location = "Colnica, working from a cluttered stall near the old south rail, where the walls still carry scrawled logos of companies long bankrupt."
description = "Franc is patient, pragmatic, and blunt, with a dry sense of humor and the kind of long memory that forgets nothing but forgives easily. He doesn’t like being asked about the past, but he listens closely when others speak of theirs."
relationships = {
"bojan_kovač": "Mutual understanding — both blunt, both good with their hands. Bojan once offered to reforge the ring’s band. Franc refused. They didn’t argue.",
"jure_hauptmann": "Quiet respect. Franc sees a lot of his younger self in Jure — tired, focused, no time for nonsense. Occasionally trades him tools or circuit stabilizers.",
"jurij_vindiš": "Longtime acquaintances. Franc sometimes stops by for hot tea and news. They rarely speak of the past, but they know each other’s stories.",
"luka_gorišek": "Doesn’t speak of Luka. Was part of the council that voted for his exile.",
"miha_sitar": "Mostly avoids him. Too many ghosts, too much drink. But once, Franc quietly replaced a broken pipe behind Miha’s shack. Never said a word about it.",
"peter_rudar": "Respectful distance. Franc believes Peter saw something real in the mines. They don’t talk much, but Franc brings him extra wire or batteries when he has them.",
"radovan_kolar": "A strange friendship, built on long silences and rare exchanges. Franc knows Radovan wants the book. He hasn’t given it — not yet. But he hasn’t locked it away either.",
"tanja_draguljič": "Finds her loud, but honest. Sometimes smiles when she argues with someone in the plaza. Trusts her to repair small metal parts, never asks her to fix the ring."
