He might not show it, but he’s been waiting to hear those words.And in return, he offers what no one else can: the correct atmospheric re-entry path. He memorized it from an old emergency beacon. The pilot of the Mara IX died in the crash — and without Luka’s knowledge, any launch attempt ends in tragedy."
